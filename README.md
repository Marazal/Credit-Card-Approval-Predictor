# Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, etc. Manually analyzing these applications is boring, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). 

This task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this example, a credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques will be produced, just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this exercise is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The filename is cc_approvals.data (although its extension is .data, the file format is .csv)
